### Getting started

Starting Shorster is very easy. Just run these commands in your terminal.

```bash
https://github.com/rafwit/shortster
cd shortster
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

### User stories

API gives the user ability to:

- Share a long URL as a short URL so it's easier to copy/paste in emails.
- Customize the short URL to recall what URL it is referencing or give it a cool name.
- See a report of created short URLs, when it was created, and how many times it was clicked.

---

### MVP

✅ User can submit an URL and receive a unique shortcode in response.

✅ User can submit an URL and shortcode and will receive the chosen shortcode if available.

✅ User can access a `/:shortcode` endpoint and be redirected to the URL associated with that

​ shortcode, if exists.

✅ All shortcodes can contain digits, uppercase and lowercase letters. It is case sensitive.

✅ Automatically allocated shortcodes are exactly 6 characters long.

✅ User submitted shortcodes must be at least 4 characters long.

✅ User can access a `/:shortcode/stats` endpoint in order to see when the shortcode was registered last accessed, and how many times it was used.

### Decision process

As Shortster is as microservice in Movingworlds environment, hence assumption was made that the user is already authenticated and authorized to use the service. In addition, I decided to use database.

**Tech-stach**:

- Node.js with Express - backend environment where I currently feel most comfortable.
- MongoDB - scalable and developer friendly database; every shortcode is going to be unique, hence I opted for non-relational collection of objects.
- Jest - testing framework that I like to use.

Code:

- 200 OK

**Example value**

```json
{
  "_id": "60170addec5de55dacdc5484",
  "origin": "www.movingworlds.org",
  "origin_short": "Z5hgxJ",
  "created_at": "2021-01-31T19:54:05.704Z",
  "numbers_clicked": 0,
  "last_clicked": 0
}
```

- 400 Bad request

**Example value**

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "CustomUrl length must be in range 4-6 inclusive, provided customUrl length is: 3"
}
```

#### ⬅ GET `'/:shortcode'`

Get your original URL to use it to redirect to origin URL

##### Responses

  "code": 404,
  "message": "This shortURL does not exist in our database."
}
```

### Tests

Shortster includes extensive test suit.

- Integration tests
  - Shortcode generation algorithm. Core feature of Shortster is to provide unique shortcodes, hence it was heavily tested.
  - API controllers and models integration tests. This API cuold not serve its purpose without correct communication between server and database, therefore tests cover their interactions.
- Unit tests
  - Error handlers
  - Shortcode generators
  - Data model

### Next steps

This part describes proposed next steps to take in order to further develop Shortster.

💡 Develop browser client layer to increase user base

💡 Develop cache to improve performance

💡 Add authentication and authorization for increased security

💡 Add e2e tests for maintance and stability

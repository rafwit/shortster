### Getting started

Starting Shorster is very easy. Just run these commands in your terminal.

```bash
https://github.com/rafwit/shortster
cd shortster
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

### User stories

API gives the user ability to:

- Share a long URL as a short URL so it's easier to copy/paste in emails.
- Customize the short URL to recall what URL it is referencing or give it a cool name.
- See a report of created short URLs, when it was created, and how many times it was clicked.

---

### MVP

‚úÖ User can submit an URL and receive a unique shortcode in response.

‚úÖ User can submit an URL and shortcode and will receive the chosen shortcode if available.

‚úÖ User can access a `/:shortcode` endpoint and be redirected to the URL associated with that

‚Äã shortcode, if exists.

‚úÖ All shortcodes can contain digits, uppercase and lowercase letters. It is case sensitive.

‚úÖ Automatically allocated shortcodes are exactly 6 characters long.

‚úÖ User submitted shortcodes must be at least 4 characters long.

‚úÖ User can access a `/:shortcode/stats` endpoint in order to see when the shortcode was registered last accessed, and how many times it was used.

### Decision process

As Shortster is as microservice in Movingworlds environment, hence assumption was made that the user is already authenticated and authorized to use the service. In addition, I decided to use database.

**Tech-stach**:

- Node.js with Express - backend environment where I currently feel most comfortable.
- MongoDB - scalable and developer friendly database; every shortcode is going to be unique, hence I opted for non-relational collection of objects.
- Jest - testing framework that I like to use.

If `customUrl` is `null` or omitted random 6 digit shortcode is generated in response. If `customUrl` is provided and with length in range 4-6 inclusive and it is not in use, Shortster will assign `originURL` to your provided `customUrl`.

Code:

- 200 OK

**Example value**

```json
{
  "_id": "60170addec5de55dacdc5484",
  "origin": "www.movingworlds.org",
  "origin_short": "Z5hgxJ",
  "created_at": "2021-01-31T19:54:05.704Z",
  "numbers_clicked": 0,
  "last_clicked": 0
}
```

- 400 Bad request

**Example value**

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "CustomUrl length must be in range 4-6 inclusive, provided customUrl length is: 3"
}
```

#### ‚¨Ö GET `'/:shortcode'`

Get your original URL to use it to redirect to origin URL

##### Responses

**Example value**

```json
{
  "origin": "www.movingworlds.org"
}
```

- 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "This shortURL does not exist in our database."
}
```

#### ‚¨Ö GET `'/:shortcode/stats'`

  "created_at": "2021-01-31T20:25:06.704Z",
  "numbers_clicked": 3,

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "This shortURL does not exist in our database."
}
```

### Tests

Shortster includes extensive test suit.

- Integration tests
  - Shortcode generation algorithm. Core feature of Shortster is to provide unique shortcodes, hence it was heavily tested.
  - API controllers and models integration tests. This API cuold not serve its purpose without correct communication between server and database, therefore tests cover their interactions.
- Unit tests
  - Error handlers
  - Shortcode generators
  - Data model

### Next steps

This part describes proposed next steps to take in order to further develop Shortster.

üí° Develop browser client layer to increase user base

üí° Develop cache to improve performance

üí° Add authentication and authorization for increased security

üí° Add e2e tests for maintance and stability
